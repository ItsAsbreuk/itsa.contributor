<div class="paragraph">How to contribute incidentally</div>

<p>
    Incidental contribution is when you fork one of <code class="prettyprint">ITSA</code>'s <a href="https://github.com/itsa" target="_blank">repositories</a>, make changes or additions and create a pull request. This is something anyone can do. Most likely you will be making changes to the code or documentation. When making additions, you better become a <a href="{{ project_contributor_url }}">project-contributor</a>.
