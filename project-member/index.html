<p>
    Being a project-member means you are owner an quardkeeper of ITSA's modules. Project-members are those who judge and merge pull requests. You can only become a project-member if you are asked to and if all current project-members agree. All project-members have equal rights.

    The project-members follow the following rules:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="blue">Merging pull requests</span> will only be done when at least 2 project-members give positive advise and there is no negative advise<li>
        <li><span class="blue">New modules</span> need to conform the vision and quality of ITSA's modules<li>
        <li><span class="blue">New project-members</span> can be proposed if all members agree<li>
    </ul>
